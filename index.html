            <h1>Trendelio Points Sign Up</h1>
            <h2>Introduction to the Points System</h2>
            <p>The brand new Trendelio point system is when you log on to the Trendelio website and redeem points that you can save up to get discounts or even free products. You can get points by logging on daily and redeeming the daily points and you can also get them by purchasing our products which give you the same amount of points as the product you have purchased so if you buy a product that is Rs. 1000 you will get 1000 points. Every 10 points are worth Rs.1, these points take the amount off of the products so if you have Rs. 100 worth of points it will take off Rs. 100 from the price of the product you are purchasing. in order to sign up for the Trendelio Points System you have to fill out the form below, even the staff can't view your information and is locked in our servers.</p>
